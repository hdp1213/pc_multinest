pc_multinest_100          Run of 100 live points over one Planck nuisance
                          parameter, A_cib_217. Tolerance at default 0.5
                          as given in eggbox_C++ example code. Output
                          written to
                            output/pc_multinest_100-*

pc_multinest_500_0.1      Run of 500 live points over same parameter at
                          0.1 tolerance. Output written to
                            output/pc_multinest_500-*

pc_speedtest_A_cib_217    Run of pc_speedtest making same number of sweeps
                          as pc_multinest_500_0.1 does in order to time
                          code. Output written to
                            output/A_cib_217_loop_times.txt
                          Only timed CPU time.

pc_speedtest_500_0.1_     Run of pc_speedtest using pc_multinest_500_0.1 as
  alltimes                a benchmark. Output written to
                            output/pc_speedtest_500_0.1_alltimes.txt
                          Timed both CPU and wall times.
                          The benchmark test.

pc_speedtest_500_0.1_     Second benchmark run of pc_speedtest to confirm
  alltimes_2              results of first run. Output written to
                            output/pc_speedest_500_0.1_alltimes_2.txt
                          Both CPU and wall times.

pc_speedtest_500_0.1_     Third benchmark run of pc_speedtest to confirm
  alltimes_3              results of first run. Output written to
                            output/pc_speedest_500_0.1_alltimes_3.txt
                          Both CPU and wall times. stdout output should
                          also contain the output from two date commands
                          run before and after the program to validify
                          wall time results.
