# pc_multinest
A program combining Planck Likelihood Code (PLC) with the Cosmic Linear
Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) to evaluate log likelihoods of different 
cosmological models.

MultiNest has been incorporated to scan parameter space and converge on the
most likely set of parameters.


## Dependencies
Following are dependencies for `pc_multinest`. Dependencies without a
hyperlink to their source are assumed to exist in some state on whichever
computing cluster that is being used. Those with links to their sources are
recommended to be compiled by hand.
- [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public)
  - OpenMP 
- [PLC](http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#cosmology)
  - [CFITSIO](http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/)
  - LAPACK and BLAS, or Intel MKL
- [MultiNest](https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/)
  - OpenMPI


## Branches
Each branch of `pc_multinest` corresponds to a different configuration used on
a different computing cluster. Each branch also has a primary development focus:
- `master`: CoEPP cloud. Development primarily focussed on `pc_multinest`
- `local`: local machine. Development primarily focussed on `pc_speedtest`
- `phoenix`: Phoenix supercomputer. Development primarily focussed on
  `pc_multinest_mpi`


## Installation
> If you wish to make `pc_multinest` from scratch, you must first invent the
> Universe.

_DISCLAIMER: This installation guide was written primarily with Phoenix users_
_in mind. Do not be alarmed if whichever system you find yourself on is not_
_covered in this guide._

There are three dependencies for `pc_multinest`. We will run through how to
build and install each dependency properly such that `pc_multinest` will be able
to use them.

Before compiling any of the dependencies, it will first be necessary to clone
into `pc_multinest` using `git`. Run
```
$ git clone git@gitlab.coepp.org.au:harryp/pc_multinest.git
```
in your home directory to clone into this repository.

### CLASS
CLASS can be downloaded (or cloned) from the
[public GitHub repository](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public). Assuming
`git` is already present on whichever computing cluster you are operating on,
to clone simply run
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public.git ~/class
```
which will create a new directory `class/` in the home directory containing the
CLASS code.

Depending on the branch you have checked out, you might need to run a patch on
CLASS. This can be done by running
```
$ patch -p3 ~/class/Makefile < ~/pc_multinest/patches/class.patch
```
from your home directory. This will patch the CLASS `Makefile` so that it uses
the correct compilers for the computing cluster you are on.

Then navigate to the `class` directory to run
```
$ make class
```
which will build CLASS. If this compiles without any errors, you're good to go!
Otherwise, you might want to examine the output and rectify it yourself.

### PLC
PLC can be downloaded in two parts from the
[ESA Planck Legacy Archive](http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#cosmology). Navigate to
the Likelihood tab and download both the _Planck_ Likelihood Code and the data
for the _Planck_ baseline results:
- `COM_Likelihood_Code-v2.0_R2.00.tar.bz2`
- `COM_Likelihood_Data-baseline_R2.00.tar.gz`

Extract both of these files using your uncompressor of choice to the home
directory. However, before building PLC it is first necessary to build CFITSIO.

#### CFITSIO
The CFITSIO source code can be downloaded from NASA's
[HEASARC Software page](http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/). Extract the
`.tar` to your home directory. To build CFITSIO, run
```
$ ./configure
$ patch -p3 ~/cfitsio/Makefile < ~/pc_multinest/patches/cfitsio.patch
$ make shared
$ make install
```
where we have patched the CFITSIO `Makefile` after it was generated by the
`configure` script. This fixes an issue on Phoenix where the script initially
finds `gcc` instead of the Intel C compiler `icc`.

With CFITSIO installed, you can now run a similar build process on PLC.
Navigating back to the PLC directory, `plc-2.0/`, you should run
```
$ patch -p3 ~/plc-2.0/Makefile < ~/pc_multinest/patches/plc.patch
$ make
$ make install
```
to make PLC. Hopefully this should work without a hitch (depending on the
version of the compiler you are using). Otherwise, you will have to do a little
bit more to fix the problem. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
section at the end for more help.

Also be sure to peruse the PLC `Makefile` in case you want to specify or change
the location of any linear algebra packages you want to link against during
the build. The Intel packages should work for Phoenix after you have patched
the `Makefile`.

### MultiNest
Now you will need to make MultiNest. This can be downloaded from
[CCPForge](https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/), where you will
need to register for an account before downloading. Using an `.edu` address will
automatically validate the account so you don't have to wait for any manual
verification that you are currently associated in some regard to a
degree-granting institution.

After extraction of the files, you should run
```
$ patch -p3 ~/MultiNest_v3.10/Makefile < ~/pc_multinest/patches/multinest.patch
$ make
```

Here, the patch increases optimisation flags and changes the default `make`
target to the shared library object `libnest3.so` instead of the default
statically linked `libnest3.a`. It also turns on MPI support for Phoenix users.

### pc_multinest
At this point, you should finally be able to compile `pc_multinest`.
Congratulations! If this goes off without a hitch, you can consider yourself
very lucky and should immediately go out and buy a lottery ticket.

Depending on which branch you have checked out, it is wise to compile
whichever executable is the primary development focus. For Phoenix, this is
`pc_multinest_mpi`. So, by running
```
$ make pc_multinest_mpi
```
you should find you are the proud owner of a sparkly fresh copy of a
parallelised `pc_multinest`.
